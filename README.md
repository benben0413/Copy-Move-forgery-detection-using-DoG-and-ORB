# DoG-ORB-copy-move-forgery-detection
Copy–Move forgery or Cloning is Image tampering or alteration by copying one area in an image and pasting it onto another area of same image. Due to availability of powerful Image editing software, the process of malicious manipulation,editing and creating fake images has been tremendously simple. Thus, there is a need of robust passive– blind image forensics(PBIF) techniques to validate the authenticity of digital Images. Copy–move forgery detection using DoG (Difference of Gaussian) blob detector to detect regions in image, with rotation invariant and resistant to noise feature called ORB (Oriented Fast and Rotated Brief) i.
